# A Trashy Game
#### A game where you pick up trash  

A random idea that was made into a game using the Jquery Draggable library.

# Directions
After you start the game trash will begin to spawn randomly. Drag them to the appropriate bin and that will increase your score. If you get more than 3 wrong, **you will die**. If you run out of time,**you die**. Oh, and there's like 4 levels.
